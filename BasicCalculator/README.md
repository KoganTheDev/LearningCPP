# Basic Calculator

## Overview

The **Basic Calculator** is a simple command-line application written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program allows users to input two numbers along with an operator to calculate the result.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User Input**: Prompts users to enter their calculations in a user-friendly manner.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for division by zero and invalid operators.

## Functionality

The calculator implements the following mathematical operations:

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

## Code Structure

The program consists of the following functions:

- **`addition(double firstValue, double secondValue)`**: Returns the sum of the two double values.
- **`subtraction(double firstValue, double secondValue)`**: Returns the difference between the first and second double values.
- **`multiplication(double firstValue, double secondValue)`**: Returns the product of the two double values.
- **`division(double firstValue, double secondValue)`**: Returns the quotient of the first value divided by the second, after ensuring the second value is not zero.

### Main Function

The `main()` function handles user input and coordinates the operations. It prompts the user for input, validates it, performs the requested calculation, and displays the result.

## Usage

To use the Basic Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o BasicCalculator BasicCalculator.cpp
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./BasicCalculator
   ```

3. Input an equation in the following format when prompted:
   ```
   <number1> <operator> <number2>
   ```
   - Example: 
     ```
     5 + 3
     ```

4. The program will display the result of the calculation.

## Example

```
Welcome to the Basic-Calculator:
Insert an equation that contains 2 numbers and an operator.
Make sure to insert space between each element.
e.g:
+ for addition.
- for subtraction.
* for multiplication.
/ for division.

5 + 3
Result: 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
```

## Error Handling

- If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display an error message and terminate.
- If an invalid operator is entered, the program will notify the user and exit.

## Conclusion

The Basic Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. It is a great starting point for learning C++ programming and understanding user input, function definitions, and basic error handling.

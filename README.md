# Learning C++

This repository contains C++ projects that I am working on to improve my programming skills. Each project focuses on different concepts and techniques in C++.

## Projects

- **Basic Calculator**: A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Guess The Number**: A simple game that allows the user to guess a number between a range the user specifies.
- **ToDo List**: A simple todo list that allows the user to manage a list of tasks.
- **Palindrome Checker**: A program that receives input from the user (string or a vector) and checks if each element is a palindrome.
- **TicTacToe**: A program that allows the user to play a game of TicTacToe.

## What I`ve Learned From Each Project:
- **Basic Calculator**: Managing I/O and functions.
- **Guess The Number**: Creating random numbers.
- **ToDo List**: Manipulating I/O and "vector" data structure.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Recurisive functions and Enums.
- **TicTacToe**: Input validation and function modularity.

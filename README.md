# Learning C++

This repository contains C++ projects that I am working on to improve my programming skills. Each project focuses on different concepts and techniques in C++.

## Projects

- **Basic Calculator**: A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Guess The Number**: A simple game that allows the user to guess a number between a range the user specifies.
- **ToDo List**: A simple todo list that allows the user to manage a list of tasks.

## What I`ve Learned From Each Project:
- **Basic Calculator**: Managing I/O and functions.
- **Guess The Number**: Creating random numbers.
- **ToDo List**: manipulating I/O and "vector" data structure.
